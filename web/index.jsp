        <h1>Reversible Data Hiding Scheme</h1>
        <p>Background/Objectives: Image encryption includes a vital role within the field of cryptography. Within the planned theme compression technique is introduced when the encryption and information concealment method to cut back the image size for quicker transmission. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Encryption scheme, 2 individual keys are used for image cryptography & information concealment with high level of security to safeguard a picture from unauthorized access. The owner of the content encrypts the first image that is not compressed by using a cryptography key. The LSBs of the image encrypted are compressed employing an information concealment key to form an area to imbed an extra information. Haar wavelet compression technique and Run - Length coding (RLC) were used. Findings: At the receiver end, the quality of the image retrieved and the information extracted are achieved solely from Run?Length Coding with their several keys. Extracted image quality is analyzed by standard and subjective metrics index are measured. Application/Improvements: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) technique shows the standard of retrieved image is same as that of the first image</p>
